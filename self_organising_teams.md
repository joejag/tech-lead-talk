Plan
 * What is an agile team
 * Military stories
 * Ways of motivating a team: C&C, Extrinsic, Intrinsic.
 * Agile team: self-actualization. Agile manifesto: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams”
 * Whole team, generaliing specialists, stable.
 * Roles are not positions, you have one or more, they can change. The team decides what they need.
 * Small teams: PL, TM, PO, ST. Supporting cast: DBA, Domain experts
 * Large teams: Architect, ProgMan, Teams of likes
 * Confusion can be caused by roles not being obvious. Use a session. 



Roles in an agile team
 * responsibilties that a person or group takes
 * agile team -> what's that? Comapred to what?

MILITARY HISTORY

Frederick the Great [PDF]: “Soldiers should fear their officers more than all the dangers to which they are exposed.... Good will can never induce the common soldier to stand up to such dangers; he will only do so through fear.”

Punish them, yell, throw them in the brig, make them peel onions on a submarine in a 2 foot cube with a farm boy

drawbacks - 

* people don't like it. Smart, usually are, so don't like 'because', but we aren't just here for happiness
* Scaling to micro-managing. military is usually the same problem, software dev isn;t. Not enough managers to micro-manage.
* Info is at a different level

Minefield - freeze - shout Mine!
When attacked - run toward the enemy while shooting. They take cover and you can aim better if you are closer

US Vietnam

Econ 101 - I give you money to do a thing I want. Off you go. You initially get what you want, then they will do anything to meet that goal, including destroying your company.

3rd way - Identify with the goal. Instrinsic motivation vs Exterinsic.

An agile team is one which is motivated by self-actualization, reaching their potential.

Agile manifesto: “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams”,

It is a whole team: it has everything it needs. DB, coder, tester, UI experts.
Generalizing specialsts. Person who is Ruby and UX. Tester and DB.
Stable. Not changing every iteration.

ROLES ARE NOT POSITIONS. A PERSon has one or more roles, which can change over time. IT IS UP TO THE TEAM TO DECIDE HOW MANY OF THE ROLES ARE REQUIRED.

SMALL TEAMS (under 20)

Common roles are:
* TL: Scrum Master, Coach, Project Lead. Facilitate, get resources, protect it from problems. Soft skills of PM. Not the planning/scheduling which is better left to the team.
* Team Member: dev, tester, creation & delivery of the system.
* Product Owner: On-site Customer represents Stakeholders. Priotized work list. Makes decisions in a timely manner, provides info.
* Stakeholer: users, managers of users, gold owner, support staff, other dev teams. Anyone impacted who is not helping to deliver.

Supporting cast: Tech Experts (DBA, overcome and transfer skills). Domain Experts (PO represents wide range, can bring in tax expert), Indepdenent Tester (complex projects, scaled)

LARGE TEAMS (over 20)

Team of teams. Generally split around your archiecture. 

Architect: overall arch pattern. Not set, more facilitate creation and evolution.
PM: Dependencies, vendor management
TL meet. POs meet.

Traditional roles:
PM: Some go to leader, most go to the team. Same with BA.


NOTHING IS SACRED

Activites:
TL:
TEAM: execute monitor, quality, risk analysis, 
PO: scope, manage stakeholders


PM is done by the team. Best leadership style in collaborative




Self organising team has: a role for choosing the direction, a role for designing the performing unit (stuff to do, how we will do it, make sure people have what they need), a role for monitoring the progress and a role for excuting the work
