ABSTRACT

"We've just hired a highly experienced developer who can join your team next week. There's one catch though, you'll have to give up your new graduate developer. What do you want to do?".

These type of questions are what you can expect to encounter when you become a tech lead. There's tensions apparent everywhere. Do you innovate or standardise? Cater for technical needs or business needs?

A tech lead needs to quickly develop a new set of skills and patterns for what gets thrown at them every day. In this talk you'll learn about situations, challenges and approaches that you can take when embarking on technical leadership. By the end you'll know how to decide if you want to keep that grad or not.


NOTES TO ORGANISERS

Every now and again you get pushed out of your comfort zone. Since taking up a tech lead position in ThoughtWorks this year I've been seeking out all the advice I can get. I'm making a load of mistakes and deliberately learning from them. I find as a developer who went to a leadership position that I didn't have a set of response patterns to problems anymore. I know how to solve a problem of a reoccurring infrastructure failure, but what about how to convince a developer who demands a decision from you when you don't have a feeling for that part of the codebase anymore? 

This talk will contain my collected learnings. I hope it will help any developers in attendance to avoid the mistakes I made, and get an understanding for what the tech lead role means.
