INTRO
=====

Lot's of talk about pratcies (tdd, refactoring, CI, CD) what about team and people? You'll eventually end up in leadership position.

Here are the skills to help you prepare, because there's not that much out there to help us.

Who am I? 
=========

Developer, often a team lead. Passion about agile, working as a team lead for 12 months

Why need a tech lead
====================

think about how you started. Dev meets story, trivial easy, go towards target. We need larger teams to scale to todays challenges. Need to share a goal, need to think about other folk. Everyone should know the target. REALITY: Start there, over time people go other directions. Does everyone know what they are there to do? Chaos, anger. I write something and it doesn't get used I feel frustrated and angry. IMPORTANT for tech lead. Vision not there from the product owner. Feels like a waste.

Does this really happen?
========================

Ten guys on the last project. All had opinions, all expresssed in the code base. Conways law. Someone new? FUCKED.

Simple test for tech lead
=========================

Does the codebase look like it was written by a single person?

Does it feel consistent? Key responsibilites as tech lead. Vision, direction. Make sure people go there.

What does it take to get there?

what does a good tech lead focus on?
====================================

3 things: active dev, people (dev small area, not thinking about team or groups we work with. Process)
3 things: architecture, leadership, coding




======
coding
======

Do effective tech leads need to still code? Yes. How much? What's the balance? AT least 30% of your time writign code with the team. At least 2 days a week.

The unspoken truth about managing geeks: Respect is the currency of the realm.
Waht do you do if you see someone surfing all day? It's frustrating. 
The amount of respect an IT pro pays someone is a measure of how tolerable that person is when it comes to getting things done.

Is this true?

Tehc changes all teh time, always new things to learn. We cannot be exceptional at everything.
We don't want to work with people that make our jobs harder.
It's hard to be a tech leader if you aren't part of the pain people are going through yourself.
You need report with teh devs and otehrs. You need to know, not just hear what people are syaing. You need competance, the team needs to know that  and you have to demonstrate it.

consistency over cleverness
===========================

A principle.

Prioritse consistency. You have churn of people. 

Clever is trying to do the right thing. But soemtimes we get caught up about what is best. There is only CONTEXTUAL BEST.

!There are more importnat topics to spend time on!

there are technically challenging problems we should explore and investigate, rather than arguing for personal preference.

What is the team culture around the dev?
========================================

Team charter of how you work.
How long does the build stay broken?
Do people avoid conflict? (checkout refactor checkin)
No picture perfect team, conflict is neccessary. Tech lead guides them through it
Do people offer new ideas? Look for creating an environment where people think they can fail. Failure is important, human learning is dependant upon it.
Tell the team when you are wrong.
Do people flag when they need help? We have personal pride. Other people have skills we need, we must tap into them to suceed.
Fo people feel ok to admit being wrong?


VISION
======

Can you articulate why your software exists? Nothing more disappoinitng then softrware that isn't used.
What is it that people need to hear to understand why they are here to do the thing they do.
Maybe you should cancel your project?



======
PEOPLE
======

Strength in Diversity. Focus on strengths, not imporving weeknesses. Focus on applying our stenghts.
Understand the strengths in teh team.


STORIES: NETFLIX

You need to work together to tap into diversity.

Humans built into a mode of working in small groups.

Trust isn't built in a day. Don't do hiking days. Fun, but  back in the work env they don't change.
Turst is incremental. Go to lunch. Create opportunites to spend social time together. Make tea together!
Small tokens are importnat. Gift economy. I do thing, you recipricate.
Don't think big bang. Think small daily activites.

Growing people
==============

Model: Challeng table vs Skill and Ability
Anxiety when high challenge, low ability
Bordeon when low challeng, high skill.
We want slightly above ability, but not too much.
Think about where skills lie. Allocate work according to this.
Ask during 1on1s. Figure out where things sit. Can give challengs, and support them. People learn and get better.
We always need more challenging work. What makes senses, and how can we supprot each other.
FROM FLOW BOOK!

Maximisign potentail
====================

Ruthlessly delegate. Person is elements, where is their skills. Where are their stregnths (completer, thinker), what are their goals and interests. Where is the overlap?

Waht can you influence? Help build skills (external folk, or pair to transfer).
Shape goals (*what are you passionate about)
Interests: Explain why some things are important to success. Gettign to live.
Cannot change strengths

Learning Activities
===================

Pair, brown bad, team code reviews, book club, tech retro,, spike showcases

spike is a learning activity. Show learnings and amplify through team.

tech retro with topic: code smalls, get together.

Beware the bad apple
====================

We can be hard on ourselves.
Some folk have a pet peeve. They always talk about.
To offset negative, you need 10 positive things.
Sometimes they need to be heard.
DO NOT LET IT STEW. It can spread or isolate the person.
You need to develop skills in conflct management. 
You mayu need to recompose your teams.



=======
PROCESS
=======

Is it ok to tell people what to do? Yes, sometimes.
Situatioanl leadership model.
Delegating, Supporting, Coaching, Directing (Support, Direct)
You need to know the task and the skills of hte person

Grads are enthusiastic. Need direction
Folk with a skill, not comfortable. COACH
Competenace, need to know why it is importnat: SUPPORT
high competenace, high commitement: DELETGATE

Tuckman's model: Teams forming. 1 person join or leave you have a new team.
embrace conflict, dicuss it, but get through it. 
Project charters help

All models are wrong, some are useful.

Think about you
===============

Make time for youself. You can feel inudated.
You cannot deal with everything. You need to spend time thinking.
What smells am I seing. What can I do?
Set aside planning time. Sit in a room on your own.
"It may look like I'm not doing anything, but I'm thinking"
Easy to become reactionary.
What are the things that no one else is thinking about?

TAKE AWAYS
==========

Think above and beyond what it means to be a developer. Impiortant and essentail skills for beign a tech lead.
2 other dimensions for people and process that make you more effective. Achieve more.
