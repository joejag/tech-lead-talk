The Talk v2
===========

# INTRO

* Joe Wright. TL. Confess.... Confess to my sins. Avoid my transgressions.
* Have you ever? Deploy. Arch Understanding. 10 coders opinions


## PATTERNS

* I haz dev patterns: Test, CI, App down
* Don't have these lead paths. Stackoverflow failed me. I don't have the pattern to pull off the shelf.


## QUOTE (Alfred)

* My Goal is this quote.
* Situations with no pattern. What I did, What I learnt
* Please grab me and help me afterwards

>> but first, same page


## TECH LEAD WHAT IS?

* Write down 3 things.

>> pat kua, colleague


## TECH LEAD VENN

* Leadership, Developer, Architect
* Dev: Hands on. Emphasis. How much?
* Lead: Feedback. Motivate. Build relationships. Resolve conflict.
* Arch: Hands on. Deployment. CFRs. Start an Evolve.

>> That said, #1 source of my problems, BRAIN "this hasn't happened before, what to do?"


## PEOPLE

* All problems are people problems. True. Dev a lot are tech problems.
* Never had an opinion on.
* No patterns.
* Exposure to this world. Sympathy for old tech leads.


>> Onwards. With Sit #1


## Sitatuon #1 TO CODE OR NOT TO CODE

SIT: All code -> problem with stakeholder (deploy world changed).
     Hands off -> No Code. Cannot resolve conflicts, or ensure vision.

* Lose respect or fail stakeholders.
* 30% time spent coding
* Respect is the currency. How easy you are.
* Lose respect by hoarding the interesting work.

>> One key skill for 30%


## DELEGATION

* Share out the responsibility. People are eager to pick up interesting bits of work.
* How to start? Diary. LB fix issue. Writing stories with BAs
* Feature Leads: Share your vision. Care about hard to change decisions, like external API.
* Bring a dev to meetings
* Focus on principles, not the impl


## Situation #2 I MUST CHOOSE ONE STYLE OF LEADERSHIP

SIT: Self organising team (support, coach). Works for some people, some of the time. But others felt left out or overly watching.

* Different people need different things
* People are seeds. How can you create the env?
* Some people need to be told exactly what to do


## SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP MODEL

* 4 styles applied to context
* Figure out the task and skills of the person
* Direct: Junior members. Very enthusiastic, lack skills -> DIRECT
* Got skill, but uncomfortable -> COACH
* Competant, but need motivation to do it (talking to unsavoury folk) -> SUPPORT
* High skill & motivation -> DELEGATE


## Situation #3 THE STANDUP CONFRONTATION

SIT: 3 days to document CI. Stare. I wonder if we can get the value another way. Ambigious. They spent a day doing it anyway.
     Day later I sat down and went through their issues.

>> Key learning points


## QUOTE (Berkun)

* They were feeling like they weren't contributing enough. Want to understand everything.
* Improvement idea. Encourage.


## Situation #4 THE GRAD DECISION

SIT: Consultancy, 6m-1y, swap normal. 2 weeks in.

* Tension: Experience vs Diversity
* Take the best?
* Delay, spend time pairing. Enthusiasm, energy & desire to learn.
* Wasn't just that, it was the cultural impact. Pessimistic left.
* Crystal ball: I wonder. Client impact, grad->dev

>> Should you take a grad?


## Quote (depends)

* Stength of your team.
* Every change is a new team.
* It's about Culture.


## Situation #5 FORGETTING ABOUT YOURSELF

SIT: You spend all your time with others. No time to think to yourself.

* Reflect on what is going on
* Inundated with calls. Leaves you reactionary, as you cannot deal with everything.
* Set aside time: block calendar, book a room, WFH
* Think about smells you are seeing. The CFRs no one else is thinking about.
* Diary -> Where this talk came from


## FINAL

* Good decisions
* Use different leadership depending on the context
* Look after yourself. Keep a diary and reach out.

THANKS!
